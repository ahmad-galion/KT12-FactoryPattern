# KT12-FactoryPattern

this pattern “defines an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses”.
This pattern delegates the responsibility of initializing a class from the client to a particular factory class by creating a type of virtual constructor.

When to Use Factory Method Design Pattern
When the implementation of an interface or an abstract class is expected to change frequently
When the current implementation cannot comfortably accommodate new change
When the initialization process is relatively simple, and the constructor only requires a handful of parameters
